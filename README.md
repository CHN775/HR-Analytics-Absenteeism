## Approach:-   
1. Understanding Data Analysis Task and Problem Statement  
2. Connecting to MySQL Workbench and Database/Table Creation  
3. Uploading Data to the Database  
4. Writing SQL Complex Join Queries  
5. SQL Query with Filters for Healthy Workers

7. Optimize SQL Query and CASE Statements  
8. Connecting Excel to Database MySQL  
9. Dashboard Development and Wireframe  
10. Final Dashboard Design  

## Tool used-  
SQL (MySQL Workbench), Advanced Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot, Dashboard, 
Pivot Tables) 

## Joining tables through queries. 
```sql
select * 
from absenteeism_at_work

```

# Insights üëé  
### Q1. To provide a list of healthy individuals with low absenteeism for our healthy bonus program. The program's total budget is $1000 USD.  

### Solution:- üîç

Based on the SQL query, we have determined that there are 111 employers who 
meet multiple criteria and are considered to be healthy with low absenteeism. We 
can offer them bonus incentives from our fixed budget to show our apprciation.         
```sql
select *
from absenteeism_at_work
where Social_drinker = 0 and Social_drinker = 0
and Body_mass_index < 25 and
Absenteeism_time < (select avg(Absenteeism_time) from absenteeism_at_work);
```
### Q2. Please calculate the wage increase or annual compensation for nonsmokers, using an insurance budget of $983,221 for all non-smokers.  
### Solution:-  
The compensation rate increase for non-smokers by 0.68 increase per hour 
which means  
$1,414.4/year.  
```sql
select count(*) as nonsmokers
from absenteeism_at_work
where Social_smoker = 0;
```
> ### COUNT= 686

To calculate the wage increase or annual compensation for non-smokers, using 
an insurance budget of $983,221 for all non-smokers, we can use the following 
steps:  
5days * 8hr = 40hr/day. it means in 52 week(1 yr) 40 hr *52 = 2080 hr  
1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by all employees:  
2080hr *686 = 1,426,880 hrs  
2. Divide the total number of hours worked by the insurance budget to get the hourly compensation rate increase:  
1,426,880 \ $983,221 = 0.68$/hr  
3. Finally, multiply the hourly compensation rate increase by the number of hours worked per year (2080) to get the annual compensation increase:  

0.68 $ * 2080 hrs = $1,414.4/yr  
Therefore, the annual compensation increase for non-smokers is $1,414.4yr
